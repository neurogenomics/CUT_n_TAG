Quick data transfer tips for CX1/AX4 (Imperial College's HPC cluster) users using iRODS server:
  - Follow our help documents for setting up iRODS client in HPC
  - module load irods/4.2.0
  - iget -Pr /igfZone/home/di.hu/IGFQ001098_hu_26-11-2020_cut-tag/fastq/2020-12-02/HK5M2BBXY

The data will be available for one month from the date of this e-mail. You can refer to the samplesheets in the fastq tarfiles for mapping facility sample ids to the original sample names.


Alignment QC:
  Now we have started providing QC reports for selected library types after alignment and primary analysis of the raw data. Please have a look at the supported library types and species information from our help page
